Coding Task #1
• Perform 10 simulation runs for the PortaCom
problem and determine the probability of loss,the maximum profit, the maximum loss, 
and the average profit. Also draw the histograms of c1,c2, x & Profit.
• Perform 1,000,000 simulation runs for the PortaCom problem and determine the probability
of loss, the maximum profit, the maximum loss, and the average profit. 
Also draw the histograms of c1, c2, x & Profit.
• Compare the results for the 10 runs and 1,000,000 runs.

Coding task #3
The service time is normally distributed with a mean of 2 minutes and a standard deviation of 0.5 minutes, 
the customer inter-arrival times are assumed to be uniformly distributed between 0 and 5 minutes.
Run the simulation for different numbers of customers 10, 10000, and 100000, and each time calculate the following,
2. Average waiting time
3. Number of customers who had to wait
4. The total time of the simulation
5. The probability that a customer will have to wait
6. Utilization of ATMs
7. Maximum number in the queue
8. Average time in the system.
9. Draw a histogram for waiting time.
10. print a table for the top 15 customers.
